# TDE 5 Elevation Ruler Integration (Das Schwarze Auge)

A FoundryVTT module that adds a speed provider to Elevation Ruler for TDE5/DSA5.

## Details

How Drag Ruler functions depends on the type of actor.

Correct attributes will be used for PC and NPC.
Sprinting for action is indicated as second threshold (speed * 2)

## Limitations

This makes no use of potential fast movement for creatures with multiple actions that can use all of them for dashing.
Main focus is on player and standard NPC or creature movement support.
